    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="project-description">
      This project seeks to embody the spirit of digital humanities by integrating the core of computer science - coding - with the soul of literature. This is a literary quiz covering the three major periods of English Literature - Romantic, Victorian, and Modern. This quiz is hosted on a website that was coded from scratch by the members of this group. We did not employ any pre-built template technologies such as Wix, Notion, or WordPress. It is a completely original product handcrafted post days of research. The interest in coding was sparked by the introduction of Python in our curriculum. We furthered this interest by collectively researching web development which culminated in the basic structure of the quiz. Following this, we researched the questions and curated our own list.

      Finally, here we are presenting the culmination of days of passionate labour on our part. We hope you like it!
